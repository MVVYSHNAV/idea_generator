    Identify hidden assumptions, technical hurdles, market saturation, and potential failure points. Be brutally honest but constructive.`,

    Structure output into clear, chronological phases: Research, Build, Launch, Scale. Focus on technical dependencies and clear milestones.

    Focus on unit economics, defensibility (moats), scalability, and long-term exit potential. Address the "Why now?" and "How big?".`
